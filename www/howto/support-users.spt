We use [Freshdesk](http://gratipay.freshdesk.com/) for managing support queries. We use a simple workflow with two states: **open** and **closed**.

## Support Workflow

* View all [open tickets](http://gratipay.freshdesk.com/helpdesk/tickets/filter/open), and see if any can be responded to, closed, or otherwise have action taken on them.
* Close or merge any tickets which are spam, duplicates, or otherwise can be immediately resolved.
* If you spot a ticket you can help with, then start working on it. Freshdesk supposedly shows when two agents are working on the same ticket, so keep an eye out for that but don't worry too much about clobbering someone else.
* Make liberal use of "Private Notes" to document your work for the rest of us. Err on the side of over-documentation.
* Regardless of what action you take, close the ticket when you're done with it. If/when the user responds, it will be reopened automatically.

## Tips for providing great support

* Respond quickly! Even if that response says you need to spend more time, this really makes people feel appreciated.
* Don't hesitate to ask for help. IRC can be great for this.
* Support staff with access to the database or financial systems have a *lot* on their plate. Help them out by getting basic details first (identity verifications, amounts, etc), and then pass them on.
* Use `about/me/*` URLs wherever you can. Providing users with a link to [their account page](https://gratipay.com/about/me/account/) is better than asking them to find it on their own. This works for [history pages](https://gratipay.com/about/me/history/) and [profiles](https://gratipay.com/about/me/) too.
* Do *not* include the Freshdesk URL in tickets. It's not immediately useful to users, and is only likely to confuse them.
* Update this page on GitHub! You can make Gratipay support even better!
