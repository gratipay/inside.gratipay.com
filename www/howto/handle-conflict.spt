When people building Gittip do not [behave well](./behave-well), it leads to
conflict. In handling conflict, our goal is repentance and forgiveness, leading
to reconciliation between the wrongdoer and the one wronged, resolution of
their respective guilt and resentment, and an even deeper unity within our
community than we enjoyed before.


## Level 0: Communicate Directly

**Your resentment is your responsibility.** If someone does something wrong to
you personally, tell them so directly. Here's a short script you can use:

<div class="script">
    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Hey, Wrongdoer! I'm frustrated at you because you stole my
    breakfast. Why am I frustrated at you?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">You're frustrated at me because I stole your breakfast. Am I
    hearing you right?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Yes. Stealing each other's breakfast isn't something we do in
    the Gittip community, because that's not kind and we try to be kind to each
    other here. Does that make sense?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Yes. I'm sorry for stealing your breakfast. Do you forgive me?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Yes.</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Thank you. What can I do to make it up to you?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Buy me lunch?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Deal!</div>

    <div class="action">WRONGED and WRONGDOER high-five and head to lunch.</div>

</div>

**Your guilt is your responsibility.** If you wrong someone and realize it on
your own, apologize:

<div class="script">
    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Hey Wronged, I stole your breakfast and that was wrong.
    I'm sorry for stealing your breakfast. Do you forgive me?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Thanks for apologizing! Yes, I forgive you.</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Thank you. What can I do to make it up to you?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Buy me lunch?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Deal!</div>

    <div class="action">Wronged and Wrongdoer high-five and head to lunch.</div>
</div>


## Level 1: See Something? Say Something!

**Community guidelines are everyone's responsibility**. If you observe
harassment against someone, speak up:

<div class="script">
    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Hey Wronged, you're dumb!</div>

    <div class="character">YOU</div>

    <div class="dialogue">Whoa! Wrongdoer, it looks like you're harassing
    Wronged. That's not okay. We want to be kind to each other here. You should
    stop and apologize!</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">I'm sorry, but ... </div>

    <div class="character">YOU</div>
    <div class="dialogue">No buts! If you're not ready to apologize right now,
    you should take a break for a bit and go offline.</div>

    <div class="action">Time passes. Perhaps YOU educate WRONGDOER, publicly or privately.</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Hey Wronged, I was a jerk. Sorry for calling you
    dumb. Do you forgive me?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Yeah, I was frustrated when you called me dumb.
    Thanks for apologizing. I forgive you.</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Thanks. What can I do to make it up to you?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGED</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Wanna help me with this thing?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Sure!</div>

    <div class="action">WRONGED and WRONGDOER high-five and work on the thing.</div>

</div>

And if you observe bad [behavior](./behave-well) that isn't directed at anyone
in particular, speak up:

<div class="script">
    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Hey everyone, check out my big dongle.</div>

    <div class="character">YOU</div>
    <div class="dialogue">You just made a sexist joke, my friend! We don't do that around
    here, because it's not kind, especially to the women among us. We want to be kind! Make
    sense?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">I'm sorry, but ...</div>

    <div class="character">YOU</div>
    <div class="dialogue">No buts! If you're not ready to apologize right now, you should take
    a break for a bit and go offline.</div>

    <div class="action">Time passes. Perhaps YOU educate WRONGDOER, publicly or privately.</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Hey you! You're right, I was a jerk. Sorry for making a sexist
    joke, everyone. Do you forgive me?</div>

    <div class="character">EVERYONE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Yes, we forgive you!</div>

    <div class="character">YOU</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Thanks for apologizing! Now didn't you have a pull
    request waiting for review?</div>

    <div class="character">WRONGDOER</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Yes!</div>

    <div class="action">YOU and WRONGDOER high-five and work on the pull request.</div>
</div>


## Level 2: Involve Gittip's Conflict Team

Sometimes you won't be able to resolve a conflict by communicating directly
with the person who wronged you, or you won't feel comfortable directly
approaching the person who wronged you without someone else present. Sometimes
no-one else from the community will step forward to help you. In that case,
contact [conflict@gittip.com](mailto:conflict@gittip.com) to involve Gittip's
conflict team.

Gittip's conflict team will mediate a conversation between you and the person
who wronged you. We are here to help and to ensure your safety, but ultimately
you are still responsible for dealing with your own resentment by communicating
directly with the person who wronged you. By working through the process of
repentance and forgiveness together with the person who wronged you, you help
them to become a better person, and you make the Gittip community as a whole
stronger.

If a person in the wrong is stubbornly unrepentant or a repeat offender,
Gittip's conflict team will take action to exclude the wrongdoer from the
community building Gittip, by removing their access to online channels and/or
physical spaces. If in the future the person repents, they may be allowed back
into the community. This will be on a limited basis at first while they earn
back trust.


## Level 3: Involve Law Enforcement

If you believe you or someone else is in physical danger in a Gittip space,
please notify law enforcement. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, contact [conflict@gittip.com](mailto:conflict@gittip.com) and we will
attempt to help you.
