Gratipay users and contributors, law enforcement and other organizations, and
the public may report potential violations of our [terms and
conditions](https://gratipay.com/about/terms/) using any of our [contact
methods](https://gratipay.com/about/contact).

When we receive a new report of a terms violation, [create an
issue](https://github.com/gratipay/violations/issues/new) in the `violations`
repo. Only "Owners" and "Safety" GitHub team members will be able to do this, 
because they're the only ones with access to that repo. If you don't have 
permission there, then email [safety@gratipay.com](mailto:safety@gratipay.com) 
instead.

Conduct an investigation using the ticket, reaching a decision about whether to
suspend the user's account. Involve the user, lawyers, and law enforcement as
appropriate. In the event that we suspend an account, notify the user in
question privately via email if possible (see
[3059](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/3059)). Don't discuss
the matter publicly, because that would violate the privacy of the user we're
investigating. [Like the
FBI](https://github.com/gratipay/inside.gratipay.com/issues/121#issuecomment-68372636),
the Gratipay Bureau of Investigation (GBI!) takes in information but doesn't
give it out.

Right now `is_suspicious` is the only real tool we have to suspend accounts, so
use that (but see [2992](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/2992)
and [3058](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/3058)).
