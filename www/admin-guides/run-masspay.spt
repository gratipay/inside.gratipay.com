Immediately after [payday](run-payday) we send money to some people using
PayPal's MassPay feature.

1. Run `./masspay.sh` to hit the database and generate three CSV files.
1. Log in to PayPal and navigate to the MassPay feature.
1. Upload the `*.paypal.csv` file from step 1 and write a note with subject
   "Gratipay Payout" and body "Here you go! Thanks for using Gratipay! :D - chad"
1. Submit the MassPay and double check the amount and the fee against the `stdout`
   from step 1 (not to be confused with the output files from step 1!).
1. If the amounts don't match then we probably have a bad `paypal_fee_cap` for one
   of the users. Manually bisect the input file from step 1, running through steps
   2 through 4 with half the file at a time until you discover the culprit. Manually
   update `paypal_fee_cap` for the culprit in the participants table, then start all
   over from step 1.
1. When everything checks out, pull the trigger on the MassPay.
1. Click the link, "View details of this Mass Payment."
1. Wait a few minutes, then refresh the page. You should see "N claimed" or
   something.
1. Download the CSV they give you. It will save as `MassPayment_Details.csv`.
1. Move the `MassPayment_Details.csv` file to `../masspay/yyyy-mm-dd.report.paypal.csv`.
1. `cd ../masspay` and `git commit` the four new files.
1. Run `./bin/masspay.py -p` to post back to Gratipay using the `record-an-exchange`
   endpoint. Make sure this works by inspecting the `exchanges` table. **Don't forget 
   this step!**
1. Note the result on the payday ticket: "MassPay done and posted back for N users."
