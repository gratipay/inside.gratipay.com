Every week early on during [payday](./run-payday) we review accounts that have
[ended up with a new Balanced
account](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/blob/master/www/dashboard/index.spt#L13-14)
in the past week. That happens on the [admin
dashboard](https://gratipay.com/dashboard/) (if you're not logged in as an
admin you should get a bare-bones 404). The purpose here is **to filter out
accounts that are likely to use stolen credit cards**.

What makes an account likely to be using a stolen credit card? That's up to you
to decide. Eventually we'll need to develop algorithms to help us decide, but
at our scale we depend on humans to decide. You are that human!

Things to check:

 - Elsewhere accounts: Do they have more than one connected? Are they clearly a
   real person?
 - Profile statement: Do they sound like someone who is the sort of person that
   is already using Gratipay?
 - Who are they giving to and/or receiving from?
 - Balanced account

Go see [The Delpan Incident](https://gratipay.com/about/fraud/2012-11-05.html)
for examples of accounts that were *definitely* fraudulent.

Make a [ticket in
`violations`](https://github.com/gratipay/violations/issues/new) for each
payday titled "review Gratipay NNN," and keep track of any review discussion and 
decisions there. Cross-link the violations ticket to the public payday ticket.
