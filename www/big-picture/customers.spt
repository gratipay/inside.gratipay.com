evolve open organizations by persuading companies to pay open source software
projects.

## Demand-Side

`~alice` and `~bob` are employees of a company representing the demand side of
the marketplace for open source software. Their company consumes open source
software and we want to help them pay for it.

`~alice` is an open source program director (or manager, or advocate, or chief
open source officer, etc.) at a company. She has budget authority and is
explicitly responsible for the relationship between the company and the open
source community, both as producer and consumer. This is the primary role we
sell to.

`~bob` is a developer who wants his company to pay for open source, but does
not have budget authority. He takes it upon himself to advocate for open
source, but does not have it as an explicit responsibility. This is a secondary
role that we sell through and with by helping them make the case within their
company.

`~alice` and `~bob` accept that supporting open source is the Right
Thing&trade; &hellip; but we're not selling altruism. Paying for open source is
actually in each company's enlightened self-interest. How can we help `~alice`
and `~bob` make the case?

- **Risk management**. Open source is an upstream supplier, and insolvent
  vendors are risky (see:
[Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed#Root_causes.2C_possible_lessons.2C_and_reactions)).

- **Marketing**. Companies with a good reputation in open source communities
  find it easier to sell to and hire from those communities.

- **Metrics**. Understanding open source consumption patterns can be difficult
  in large organizations.

- **Social validation**. Companies need to feel that they're not the only one
  paying, but rather that they're part of an industry trend.


## Supply-Side

`~picard` is the manager (owner?) of an open organization, and  `~crusher` is a
contributor to the organization (co-owner, employee, contractor, agent). These
are the supply-side customers in our markeplace. We saw this side of the market
grow at 3% month-over-month even while we were growing 0% on the demand side,
so we're not as focused on selling to this side. The open source community is
so desperate for money that if we can unlock the demand side, the supply side
should basically take care of itself.

Once unlocked, though, we will get into the interesting question of the
[marketplace between projects and
contributors](https://opensource.com/open-organization/16/7/compensating-employees-letting-them-take-what-they-want).
Some day!
