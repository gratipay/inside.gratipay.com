Here are the style guides we use as a baseline for various languages:

- [Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- [JavaScript](http://nodeguide.com/style.html)
- CSS - ???
- SQL - ???

And here are a couple "house rules" (these apply to all languages):

- 4-space indents
- 100-character lines
- trim trailing space

When in doubt:

- Make it look like existing code.
- Ask around on IRC or GitHub.
- Assume we'll flag issues in code review or reformat after the fact.
