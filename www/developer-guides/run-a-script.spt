We have a number of scripts that we use for support tasks. They generally
require two levels of configuration: virtualenv and heroku.


## virtualenv

Python's sandboxing mechanism is called
[`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). When you build the
`gratipay.com` repo locally, you get a virtualenv at `./env/` that has all
the libraries and tools you'll need to run scripts.

If you invoke a script as `./env/bin/python bin/script.py` then you're using
the Python interpreter in the virtualenv and you're all set.


## Heroku

We store our production configuration as environment variables in Heroku, so to
run a script against production you need to call it under the influence of
`heroku`, either locally or remotely.

To call a script locally use `heroku config` with
[`honcho`](https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho):

```
$ heroku config -sa gratipay | ./env/bin/honcho run -e /dev/stdin \
    ./env/bin/python bin/script.py
```

To call a script on a remote Heroku dyno use `heroku run`:

```
$ heroku run -a gratipay bash
Running `bash` attached to terminal... up, run.2359
~ $ python bin/script.py
```

We pay by the minute for dynos, so close it when you're done!


## invoke

We're in the process of migrating scripts to
[`invoke`](https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke) tasks (see
        [#2294](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/2294)). When
            you build `gratipay.com` we'll install `invoke` in the
            virtualenv. Here's how to list the `invoke` tasks locally:

```
$ ./env/bin/invoke --list
```

And remotely:

```
$ heroku run -a gratipay bash
Running `bash` attached to terminal... up, run.2359
~ $ invoke --list
```

We pay by the minute for dynos, so close it when you're done!
